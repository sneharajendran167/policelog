**A Python SQL digital ledger for police post logs**

**INTRODUCTION:**

  The Police Log Project is a Python–SQL based digital ledger designed to streamline and modernize police check-post operations. Instead of relying on scattered paper logs or manual reports, this project provides a centralized database and an interactive dashboard to record, track, and analyze vehicle stops in real-time.

**FEATURES:**

  1)Data Cleaning - Handling NAN values in Python
  
  2)SQL database intregation - Store and manage data in MySQL
  
  3)Real time dashboard - Use Streamlit dashboard for live vehicle logs and violation tracking
  
  4)Interactive search filter - Quickly find the records based on the driver's details
  
  5)Demographic analysis - Breakdown by driver age,gender,race and stop outcome
  
  6)Time based trends - Analyze the stop by hour,day,month
  
  7)Key metrices - Show the total stops,total warning,total arrest,drug related stops
