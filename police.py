        **SecureCheck: Police Traffic Stop Analysis**

        This project analyzes real-world police stop data:
        - Driver demographics (gender, age, race)  
        - Types of violations (speeding, seatbelt, DUI, etc.)  
        - Stop outcomes (ticket, warning, arrest)  
        - Searches and drug-related stops  
        - Duration and time patterns of stops  

        ### Objectives
        - Identify trends in traffic stops and enforcement.  
        - Highlight potential risk factors leading to searches or arrests.  
        - Provide insights for safer roads and fairer enforcement.  

        ### Features
        - **Data Overview**- Browse raw police stop data.  
        - **Predictions**- Generate a narrative prediction of stop outcomes.  
        - **Insights Dashboard** -State-wise and vehicle-wise summaries.
